This is a repo for our 2024 Electrical and Computer Engineering capstone project: MD_Vision

This is the simplest buildable example. The example is used by command `idf.py create-project`
that copies the project to user specified path and set it's name. For more information follow the [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project)

## How to build the project:
ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

## Required Libraries and IDF-Components
